  "NDBIDesc": "NDBI represents how full an area is with buildings, including settlements. A low NDBI value indicates the area is covered by vegetation or water. The magnitude of the NDBI index is directly proportional to the surface temperature. ",
  "NLDesc": "This night-time light data from VIIRS offers a unique opportunity to directly observe human activity from space. This has allowed a host of applications including mapping urban areas and also estimating population and GDP.",
  "NDVIDesc": "The NDVI is a dimensionless index that describes the difference between visible and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation cover and can be used to estimate the density of green on an area of land (Weier and Herring, 2000). If the index value is lower, it means that there is less vegetation and the temperature in that location will increase.",
  "UHIDesc": "urban heat island is a condition when urban areas experience much warmer temperatures than nearby rural areas. This occur because cities replace natural land cover with dense concentrations of pavement, buildings, and other surfaces that absorb and retain heat. This effect increases energy costs (e.g., for air conditioning), air pollution levels, and heat-related illness and mortality."
